# EMI calculator

- This EMI calculator shall display the loan EMIs on a car or home loan with a down Payment ( if any ).
- This can be used while Investing, Insurance, House, Car, or anything.
- For example, you want to buy a house for Rs 50,00,000. You would make a down payment of 20% or Rs 50,00,000 * 0.2 = Rs 10,00,000.
- The bank would sanction the home loan of Rs 40,00,000. You have processing fees of 1% of the loan amount or Rs 40,00,000 * 0.01 = Rs 40,000.
- The total amount you need for the down payment is Rs 10,00,000 + Rs 40,000 = Rs 10,40,000. Total down payment = Rs 10.4 lakh.
- EMI amount = [P x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1] where P, R, and N are the variables. This also means that the EMI value will change every time you change any of the three variables.
    - ‘P’ stands for the Principal Amount. It is the original loan amount given to you by the bank on which the interest will be calculated. 
    - 'R’ stands for the Rate of Interest set by the bank. 
    - ‘N’ is the Number of Years given to you for loan repayment.
