# Mongo DB Interview questions

1. What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a widely used, open-source NoSQL database designed for high performance, scalability, and flexibility. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for a dynamic schema that can easily adapt to changing requirements.

2. What is a NoSQL database, and how does it differ from SQL databases?
NoSQL is ideal for flexibility and scalability, while RDBMS is best for structured data and transactional integrity.
1. Data Model
    - NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB): Uses a flexible, document-oriented model (JSON-like), allowing for schema-less design and easy evolution.
    - ies on a fixed schema with table-based structures, ideal for structured data and defined relationships.
2. Scalability
    - NoSQL: Supports horizontal scaling (sharding), making it easier to scale across multiple servers.
    - RDBMS: Typically uses vertical scaling, which involves adding resources to a single server.
3. Flexibility
    - NoSQL: Agile and quick to adapt, allowing for rapid development and schema changes.
    - RDBMS: Requires upfront schema design, making it less flexible during development.
4. Transactions
    - NoSQL: Generally follows eventual consistency with some support for multi-document transactions.
    - RDBMS: Strong ACID compliance ensures reliable transactions and consistency.
5. Use Cases
    - NoSQL: Best for big data, real-time analytics, and applications with evolving data models.
    - RDBMS: Suited for transactional applications, structured data storage, and environments requiring strong consistency.
