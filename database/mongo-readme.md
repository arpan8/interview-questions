# Mongo DB Interview questions

### 1. What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a widely used, open-source NoSQL database designed for high performance, scalability, and flexibility. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for a dynamic schema that can easily adapt to changing requirements.

### 2. What is a NoSQL database, and how does it differ from SQL databases?
NoSQL is ideal for flexibility and scalability, while RDBMS is best for structured data and transactional integrity.
1. Data Model
    - NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB): Uses a flexible, document-oriented model (JSON-like), allowing for schema-less design and easy evolution.
    - ies on a fixed schema with table-based structures, ideal for structured data and defined relationships.
2. Scalability
    - NoSQL: Supports horizontal scaling (sharding), making it easier to scale across multiple servers.
    - RDBMS: Typically uses vertical scaling, which involves adding resources to a single server.
3. Flexibility
    - NoSQL: Agile and quick to adapt, allowing for rapid development and schema changes.
    - RDBMS: Requires upfront schema design, making it less flexible during development.
4. Transactions
    - NoSQL: Generally follows eventual consistency with some support for multi-document transactions.
    - RDBMS: Strong ACID compliance ensures reliable transactions and consistency.
5. Use Cases
    - NoSQL: Best for big data, real-time analytics, and applications with evolving data models.
    - RDBMS: Suited for transactional applications, structured data storage, and environments requiring strong consistency.

### 3. What is a document in MongoDB?

A document is a data record similar to a row in a relational database but more flexible. It is a JSON-like structure (stored in BSON format) that can contain key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, allowing for complex data to be stored in a single, self-contained entity.

### 4. What is a collection in MongoDB?

A collection is a group of documents, similar to a table in a relational database. Collections store related documents and can have documents with different structures, as MongoDB does not enforce a strict schema.

### 5. How does MongoDB store data?

MongoDB stores data in a binary JSON format called BSON (Binary JSON). Data is organized into collections, where each record is stored as a document. These documents are flexible, allowing for various data types, nested structures, and arrays within a single document. This schema-less approach enables dynamic and scalable data storage.

### 6. What are the primary types of indexes in MongoDB?

The primary types of indexes in MongoDB are:

1. Single Field Index: Indexes a single field in a document, improving the speed of queries on that specific field.
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, index: true } // Single field index on 'name'
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```
2. Compound Index: Indexes multiple fields within a document, useful for queries that involve multiple fields.
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number
});

// Compound index on 'name' and 'age'
userSchema.index({ name: 1, age: -1 });

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```
3. Multikey Index: Used to index array fields, where each element of the array is indexed.
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  hobbies: [String] // Array field for which we need a multikey index
});

// Multikey index on 'hobbies'
userSchema.index({ hobbies: 1 });

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```
4. Text Index: Supports text search queries by indexing the contents of string fields.
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const articleSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  content: String
});

// Text index on 'title' and 'content'
articleSchema.index({ title: 'text', content: 'text' });

const Article = mongoose.model('Article', articleSchema);
```
5. Geospatial Index: Enables querying of geospatial data, such as location-based queries.
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const locationSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  location: {
    type: { type: String },
    coordinates: [Number]
  }
});

// Ensure 'type' is 'Point'
locationSchema.index({ location: '2dsphere' });

const Location = mongoose.model('Location', locationSchema);
```
6. Hashed Index: Indexes the hash of a fieldâ€™s value, commonly used for sharding.
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: { type: String, unique: true }
});

// Hashed index on 'email' (for sharding)
userSchema.index({ email: 'hashed' });

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```
Each type serves different query and performance needs, optimizing data retrieval in MongoDB.
