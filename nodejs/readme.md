# node js interview-questions

## 1. What is the role of framework ?
Role of the framework is to simplify the creation of large application, by providig many reusable classes, functions and library etc.

## 2. What is runtime enviornment ?
A runtime enviornment is a enviornment that executes the program. 
e.g cpython is the runtime enviornment for django framework to execute the python.
like this JVM is for spring framework, CLR is for dotnet framework.

So runtime environment is responsible for memory management, I/O operations and converting the high level language (JAVA,Javascript) to lower level language (machine language), which system can understand.

## 3. What is a framwork ?
A structure that simplifies the development process, by offering structured set of tools, libararies, best practices, reusable classes and functions. This structure is called Framework. The framework is just like a wrapper over the runtime environment.
e.g. Javascript has framework Angular, Vue. React is a library of javascript. Node js is a runtime environment of javascript.

## 4. What is nodejs ?
Nodejs is a runtime enviornment to execute the javascript code on the server side.

## 5. What is V8 ?
V8 is a javascript engine, chorme has the V8, Edge has chakra, firefox has spider monkey

## 6. What are the key features of node js ?
- **Asynchronous & Non-Blocking**
- **Single threaded**
- **Event driven**
- **V8 Javascript engine**
- **Cross platform**
- **NPM(Node Package Manager)**
- **Real time capabilities**

## 7. What is Single Threaded Programming ?
A single-threaded program contains only one main thread of execution. It processes tasks sequentially, one after the other. Single-threaded programs are straightforward and easy to reason about, making them suitable for simple applications with limited concurrency requirements.

## 8. What is Synchronous programing ?
Synchronous programming is a programming model where operations take place sequentially.i.e. each task is performed one after another, and waits for previous task to complete before going to the next task.

## 9. What is Asynchronous programming ?
Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows tasks to run independently of the main program flow, enabling non-blocking operations and improving efficiency, especially in I/O-bound and high-latency operations.

## 10. What is the difference between node js and express js?
Node js is a runtime javascript engine that executes javascript code apart from browser.

Express js is a framework of nodejs. It simplifies the process of creating api routes, middleware etc. So this express js is a wrapper over the nodejs.
