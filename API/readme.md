# Rest api interview questions

## 1. What is Rest API?
A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a set of rules for building web services that allows systems to communicate over the web using standard HTTP methods. Key features include:

1. Statelessness: Each request is independent, with no client session stored on the server.
2. Resources: Resources (like users or orders) are identified by URIs (e.g., /users/123).
3. HTTP Methods: Common methods include:
    - GET: Retrieve data
    - POST: Create new data
    - PUT: Update existing data
    - DELETE: Remove data
4. Data Formats: Typically uses JSON or XML for data exchange.

REST APIs are commonly used for building scalable and flexible web services.
